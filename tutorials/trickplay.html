<p>
Shaka Player supports trick play, a rewind/fast-forward style of
seeking. Trick play is supported through the {@link shaka.player.Player}
method setPlaybackRate. The setPlaybackRate method should always be used
instead of setting video.playbackRate directly as video.playbackRate does
not support rewind (on any browser we have tested). Standard playback rate
is 1 and paused is 0. To rewind, use a negative playback rate. To fast-forward,
use a positive playback rate greater than 1.

<pre class="prettyprint source"><code id="trickplay_sample1">var video = document.getElementById('video');
var player = new shaka.player.Player(video);

// Fast-Forward (2x).
player.setPlaybackRate(2);

// Rewind (-2x).
player.setPlaybackRate(-2);
</code></pre>

See {@link https://goo.gl/X0bdwe control.js} for a fully functional sample
implementation.
