Live Streaming Issues
</h3>

<p>
Shaka Player supports live streaming since v1.3.0.  Live streams are handled by
{@link shaka.player.DashVideoSource}, and there is no difference in the API for
live vs static content.
</p>

<p>
Live content can, however, contain large timestamps. This can make the built-in
controls on the video tag (or any other naive UI) confusing. The currentTime on
the video may report as something like 397002:54:56. This is not a very helpful
or meaningful number to the user. Plus, if the video "started" over 300k+ hours
ago, seeking to 0 is not realistic.  The server is surely not keeping that much
content sitting around.
</p>

<p>
In reality, live content limits the range in which the user may seek.  One live
stream may allow the user to seek backward 5 minutes, while another may allow 4
hours. If a user tries to seek to a point outside of this range, the player can
clamp this value to one within the seek range. Better still is to show the user
a meaningful range of content in the seek UI.
</p>


<h3 class="tutorial-heading">
Seek Range Events
</h3>

<p>
{@link shaka.player.DashVideoSource.event:SeekRangeChanged} events give the app
the information it needs to present a better live stream UI.  An app which does
not support live streams may safely ignore them.  An app which does not support
seeking in a live stream may also ignore them.
</p>

<p>
A SeekRangeChanged event contains "start" and "end" timestamps which define the
range of time which is currently seekable.  Over time, this window of available
content will move to the right in the video timeline.
</p>

<p>
The "end" time corresponds to the most recent available live content. Therefore
to jump forward to the "live edge", the application would set video.currentTime
to the range's "end" time.
</p>

<p>
Rather than display actual timestamps from the video stream, which may be quite
large, we recommend displaying an offset from the live edge.  For example, when
the user is watching content 1 minute and 30 seconds behind the live edge, show
"-1:30".
</p>

<p>
During live playback, the user's offset from the live edge is roughly constant,
so any time code displayed would only be changed by buffering or seeking.
</p>

<p>
For an example of a UI which uses the SeekRangeChanged event, see controls.js.
</p>


<h3 class="tutorial-heading">
Clock Synchronization
</h3>

<p>
Segment availability for live streams is based on the current time.  You cannot
access segments from the future, but the manifest may give you enough detail to
know their locations in advance. Therefore, if the client's clock is not synced
with the server's clock, the client might request unavailable segments.
</p>

<p>
Clock synchronization between client and server is important. In the DASH spec,
it states (under heading A.3.1) that "clients are expected to synchronize their
clocks to a globally accurate time standard."  It does not specify how, though.
</p>

<p>
Shaka Player uses a very simple mechanism for clock sync. When the library asks
the server for a manifest, the HTTP Date response header is used to synchronize
the client's {@link shaka.util.Clock virtual clock} with the server. All timing
for the live stream is based on this virtual clock, rather than the system time
of the client.  This has a few advantages.
</p>

<p>
Rather than requiring synchronization to a globally accurate time standard, our
mechanism requires only that the server time is consistent between the manifest
and the web server.  This self-consistency is a lighter-weight requirement than
the one in the DASH specification, and one which we think is easier to satisfy.
</p>

<p>
The HTTP specification requires the Date header for all responses, so it should
always be present.  By using the Date header, we avoid the need for out-of-band
clock synchronization mechanisms.
</p>


<h3 class="tutorial-heading">
Clock Synchronization vs CORS
</h3>

<p>
If your application operates <a href="http://goo.gl/meEW9Q">same-origin</a>, no
special configuration is required for clock synchronization.  If manifests come
from another origin, your server must allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, also
known as <a href="http://goo.gl/vqldIX">CORS</a>. The response for the manifest
must include the "Access-Control-Expose-Headers" header with "Date" in the list
of values. If this is not given, the browser will not permit the application to
read the Date header. Chrome will log an error message to the JS console saying
"Refused to get unsafe header".  (Note that this is coming directly from Chrome
and cannot be silenced by the library.)
