<p>
There are several content scenarios we do not support.  We make no claims about
their validity within the DASH specification nor any related specification.  We
have not found any of these things in any existing DASH content.  Most of these
restrictions allow us to make simplifying assumptions in the code.

<ul>
  <li>MPD Representations containing more than one of SegmentBase, SegmentList,
      or SegmentBase.</li>
  <li>MPD SegmentTimeline combined with an explicit segment index URL.</li>
  <li>Representations within an AdaptationSet where the MIME type varies.</li>
  <li>Changing DRM schemes across MPD Periods.</li>
  <li>Changing DRM schemes when switching MPD Representations.</li>
  <li>WebM streams without initialization segments.</li>
  <li>Parsing dynamically-sized EBML elements in WebM streams.</li>
  <li>Parsing 8-byte EBML IDs in WebM streams. *</li>
  <li>Parsing EBML integers with more than 53 significant bits in WebM streams.
      *</li>
  <li>Parsing nested SIDX boxes in MP4 streams.</li>
  <li>MPD updates that add or remove entire Periods or AdaptationSets.</li>
</ul>

* = JavaScript limitation
